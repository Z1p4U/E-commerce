                "description" => "Adidas is a German athletic shoe and apparel brand founded in 1948 by Adolph “Adi” Dassler. The company name is a actually a hybrid of “Adi” and “Dassler,” though it also is popularly known as an acronym for “All Day I Dream About Sport.”
                The company’s distinct three-bar logo which adorns most of their apparel and merchandise was originally used by a Finnish apparel company called Karhu Sports. Adidas bought the logo from Karhu in 1951.

                Adolph Dassler’s interest in athletic footwear production began with his return from World War I. The Dassler Brothers began manufacturing shoes from their mother’s laundry business. The shoes were first used in an Olympics event in 1928, and were the first athletic shoes to feature studs and spikes. Women’s 800M competitor Lina Radke-Batschauer was the first athlete to win a gold medal in the shoes. In 1936, the Dassler brothers drove samples to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, where they persuaded American athlete Jesse Owens to try to the shoes. This represented, in essence, the first athletic sponsorship of an African-American athlete. Owens’ four gold medals from the 1936 Olympics greatly improved the company’s reputation, and athletes around the world were requesting a pair of the Dassler Brothers shoes.

                The Dassler brothers had a falling out after World War II . Adolph and Rudolf dissolved the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory and parted ways, each going on to form rival shoe companies. Brother Rudolf founded athletic shoe company Puma, also based in Herzogenaurach, where Adolph Dassler registered Adidas as a company in 1949.

                Adidas’ reputation as a shoe manufacturer expanded over the years as the company shod winning athletes and several winning sports teams in notable victories, such as Germany’s 1954 World Cup victory over Hungary, known today as the “Miracle of Bern.” This game was the first in which the players wore football shoes with removable studs. The company began producing shoes not just for track and field or football, but tennis, golf, boxing boots for Muhammad Ali, and footwear for other sports. The company even produced an early “shower shoe” at the request of athletes who wanted a rubber slip-on to wear in the locker room. Some of the companies most enduring styles—the Samba, the Adilette, the Superstar—have been in production for 40 years or more.

                Adidas began producing athletic apparel in 1960 and added athletic equipment such as footballs to its offerings in 1963. Since 1970, the official ball at all important football events has been an Adidas-branded ball.

                Founder Adolph Dassler passed away in 1978, but the company continued under the leadership of his wife Käthe and son Horst. Horst passed away unexpectedly in 1987. Adidas AG officially became a corporation in 1989 and that same year, the company was bought by French businessman Bernard Tapie. It was later sold to Robert Louis-Dreyfus in 1993. Under the leadership of Dreyfus, Adidas expanded with the acquisition and sell-off of multiple sports and athletic companies. Adidas acquired the Reebok brand in 2006. Today, Adidas AG offers products under the Adidas, Reebook, Taylor-Made Adidas Golf Comapny and Rockport brands.

                Adidas partnered with Coty in 1985 to produce a line of fragrances. They have achieved particular success in the male market, and fragrances and body care products are marketed under the Adidas brand in more than 82 countries today. The fragrances for men and women often feature a sporty name and bottle design."

                The brothers left for Italy in 1991 with the dream of creating their own line. Design work for Versace and Diesel eventually led to their first menswear collection under the Dsquared2 brand, which made its debut in Milan, with financial backing provided by Diesel. The success of their menswear collection allowed for the expansion into women’s wear, with their first women’s collection introduced in 2002. Their first collection for women earned them praise and a front-page feature in “Women’s Wear Daily.”

                In 2002, the pair also signed a licensing deal which expanded the brand’s offerings into footwear, accessories and fragrances.

                The Dsquared2 brand is known for its extravagant and energetic fashion shows, many of which feature musicians and celebrities such as Rihanna and Christina Aguilera making a unique entrance and taking a stroll on the runway. The pair’s designs have a loyal celebrity following and the clothes often turn up in music videos or amongst the costumes for a world tour. Madonna commissioned the pair to design the costumes for her 2002 “Drowned World” tour, and Britney Spears included Dsquared2 clothing in her Circus tour in 2009.

                Dsquared2 have won numerous fashion awards, including the Golden Needle (Spain), La Kore (Italy) and GQ magazine’s Best Breakthrough Design Team and Men of the Year (for both GQ Spain and the American edition).

                The Dsquared2 brand offered its first fragrance in 2007, He Wood. The women’s companion, She Wood, was launched in 2008. Dsquared2 fragrances are produced in conjunction with ITF Group."

                Fragrances, colours, thoughts and Etro’s perfumes filtered into a picture book like a recipe album. A novel idea to remind us that just as the cooking of food was the first sign of civilisation, perfumes – the refined transformation of the aromatic notes that surround us – are another sublime sign of civilisation. Perhaps its most mysterious and exciting because impalpable, ephimeral, invisible.

                Which adds even more intrigue and allure to Etro’s book as it stimulates our sight to talk about olfaction. Enticing our eyes to tickle our nostrils, using colour to spark the desire for a perfume, juxtaposing texts and images to play with our imagination. Each chapter takes its cue from the rules of colour therapy to talk about a group of fragrances no longer divided into olfactive families, but linked to the suggestive hues of a colour.

                The certainty of white, the zest of yellow, the happiness of green, the enthusiasm of orange. And of course the passion of red, the intuition of indigo, the languour of blue, the naturalness of green. Like the alchemist’s most treasured volume, each page explores the colour syntax before telling us the story and giving us the magic formula of each of the 22 Etro fragrances. Among which we discover Pegaso, the label’s new “recipe”, a blend of lime and bergamot with a dash of neroli, a sprinkling of cedarwood, a drop or two of benzoin and rockrose and as much basil, pepper and iris as you want. Almost a poem that speaks to our soul, bringing us an echo of ancient passions but also promising us a future tinged with emotions.

                And looking to the future, Etro has redesigned the entire line of packaging, choosing a more modern graphic look, highlighted by paisley motifs in optical black and white shot with purple details to match the spirit of both the times and the Etro brand. An era with an insatiable hunger for feelings, sublimated by fragrances that we can now carry with us in the new smaller 50ml bottles, a special food for the senses to accompany us everywhere.

Top notes are Blackberry, Litchi, Raspberry and Bergamot; middle notes are Gardenia, Magnolia, Lime (Linden) Blossom and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Amber, Woodsy Notes and Musk.

                The fourth fragrance from the house of Judith Leiber and the third one from the collection inspired by Streamline clutch design, is launched as the beginning of 2012 under the name of Amethyst. Amethyst, just like the previous Topaz, is named after the mineral that is often used in jewelry of this brand.
                Unlike its rich and oriental predecessors, Amethyst brings fresh and sparkling floral fruity composition. It is developed by Ilias Ermenidis of Firmenich. The composition begins with fruity accords of litchi, bergamot and boysenberry, the hybrid fruit of blackberry, rapsberry and loganberry. The heart is floral and includes magnolia, gardenia, linden blossom and lily of the valley. Creamy woods, muck and amber are in the finish.

                The bottle retains the form of the previous two launches, designed by Joseph Messina. It is transparent and colored in purple. The fragrance is available as 40 and 75 ml Eau de Parfum."

                Kilian Hennessy spent his childhood among the family’s wine cellars in Cognac. After graduating from a program in communications and language studies, where wrote a thesis on semantics of odors in the search for a common language between gods and mortals, Kilian went on to study with some of the greatest noses in perfumery, honing his craft creating perfumes for some of the top fashion brands in the industry.

                In 2007, Kilian launched his own perfume house, in keeping with the family’s long tradition of producing luxury goods.

                Collection L’oeuvre noire (“Black Masterpiece”) was first launched in 2007, with new fragrances added to the collection each year and a total of ten fragrances available so far.

                Collection Arabian Nights, featuring oud-based fragrances with an oriental theme and a distinctive package, was launched in 2009 with Pure Oud. Two additional oud-based fragrances have since been added to the collection.

                The company emphasizes ecology and sustainability through the use of refillable, reusable packaging. The perfumer’s forumlas are also available for each scent on the official website.

                By Kilian has launched limited editions of several fragrances in the collection, in special luxury packaging. The brand also expanded its offering to include evening handbags in 2011."

                Reminiscence is a French jewelry and perfume house founded in 1970 by Zoe Coste and Nino Amaddeo. Offering bold and colorful costume and silver jewelry from a small boutique in Juan-les-Pins on the Côte d’Azur, the company recognized the importance of fragrance as an accessory and launched that same year its first perfumes—Patchouli, Ambre and Musc—in collaboration with brand Ylang-ylang.

                In 1980, the Reminiscence International Diffusion company was born and Reminiscence was able to offer fragrances and jewelry under its own brand name.

                Their reputation grew during the 1980s, with additional shops opening in Cannes and Paris. A popular addition to the line has been the Rems—tiny charms to adorn necklaces and bracelets, available in nearly every shape or style.

                The business remains in family hands, with the children of the founders, Lilla Amadeo and Sebastien Coste, joining the business in the 21st century. The company’s first three fragrances are still in production, and the Patchouli scent’s popularity has resulted in several flankers and limited editions over the years."

This iconic brand has developed and evolved along this theme since its debut, taking the best of the past and giving it a contemporary twist."

                "description" => "Versace is an Italian fashion design house founded by the late Gianni Versace and continued by other members of the Versace family after his death. Debuting with a line of women’s wear in 1978, the company was an instant success. A men’s line and the company’s first boutique in Milan followed in that same year. Gianni Versace chose the Medusa symbol as his company’s logo. The company’s luxurious clothing and accesories are characterized by influences ranging from pop art to classical Greek and Roman architecture.

                Versace became a favorite amongst celebrities—Elton John was an early fan—and the house is unique among Italian fashion houses for its consistent use of celebrities in advertising campaigns. Celebrities who have at one time been the face of Versace include Madonna, Ashton Kutcher, Britney Spears and Halle Berry. Some credit Versace with contributing to the “supermodel” phenomenon of the 1990s when the company cast every top fashion model for its 1991/1992 Autumn and Winter runway show.

                Versace’s lines grew to include accessories, home furnishing and cosmetics. The brand inclues mulitple lines today: Atelier Versace, Versace Couture, Versace Jeans Couture, Versace Home Collection, Versace Collection, and Versus (Versace). In addition to clothing and accessories, the brand also encompasses a hotel, the Palazzo Versace. Versace Couture is the main line of the house and includes the fragrance division.

                The first Versace fragrance, Gianni Versace for Women, was introduced in 1981. Fragrances for men and women are offered under the Versace, Versus, Jeans and Jeans Couture labels. Versace fragrances are produced in conjunction with Euroitalia SRL.

                Gianni Versace fell victim to an American spree murderer in 1997, but the company continues offering fashions and fragrances under the direction of his family. Sister Donatella, formerly the vice-president of the company and the leader of the Versus division, as well as Gianni Versace’s longtime muse and the inspiration for the fragrance Blonde (1995), took over as creative director. Older brother Santo Versace is president and CEO. Niece Allegra Versace is 50% owner of the company."
